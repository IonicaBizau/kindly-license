> A human readable license for projects created by human-beings.

## Why yet another license?

I'm not a supporter of closed source software. I do not promote it. This license contains simple and human readable terms. It lets the author to decide if he/she allows using their work in closed source projects or not. :four_leaf_clover:

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`

Thanks! :heart:


### Editing the license content

If you found a way to improve the license content, there are two places where you have to change it:


 - in the `LICENSE.kindly` file
 - in `README.md` (*The license content*)


After modifying `LICENSE.kindly` you can run `npm run install` to update the other files.
